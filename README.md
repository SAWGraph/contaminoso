# contaminOSO
The Contaminant Observations and Samples Ontology (ContaminOSO) models observations of contaminants in the environment. These are primarily sampled observations, such as from water or soil samples, but also extend to reported observations, such as annual release reports of facilities that are mandated by EPA. 

The current status of the conceptual model is documented in the [conceptual](conceptual/) subfolder.
